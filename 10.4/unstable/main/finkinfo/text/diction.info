Description: Identifies diction and style errors
DescDetail: <<
Diction and style are two old standard UNIX commands. Diction identifies
wordy and commonly misused phrases. Style analyses surface characteristics
of a document, including sentence length and other readability measures. 

These programs cannot help you structure a document well, but they can
help to avoid poor wording and compare the readability (not the
understandability!) of your documents with others. Both commands support
English and German documents.
