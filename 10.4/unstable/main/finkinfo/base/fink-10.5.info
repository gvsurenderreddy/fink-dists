You appear to be using the "pangocairo" packages branch, which is now
obsolete and no longer being maintained. See the extended information
about the fink package using 'fink info %f' at a Terminal prompt or
"Show Package Info..." in the "Tools..." menu in FinkCommander.

Description: The Fink package manager
DescPackaging: <<
Set %v-%r just higher than what was present just before branch merged
into HEAD so that this .info is "highest %v-%r" (triggering build, and
therefore build-failure, during selfupdate) iff user is still using
the branch.
<<
DescDetail: <<
fink is the Fink project's package manager. It is responsible for
downloading and compiling source and building binary packages from
it. Binary package handling is then delegated to dpkg.

This version of fink represents the EOL for the "pangocairo" CVS
branch of the 10.4/10.5 source distribution. This branch was a
temporary testing-area that has now been merged into the main distro.
While you may continue to use this branch without harm, no further
bug-fixes or version updates to any packages will occur in it.
<<
DescUsage: <<
To swich back to the main package distro, decide if you want to
continue using 'cvs' as the SelfUpdateMethod, or switch (or switch
back) to using 'rsync'. Use the following commands at a terminal
prompt:

  To remain with 'cvs', the following set of commands will undo what
  you had done to switch to the pangocairo branch within the cvs
  method.

    % cd %p/fink/dists
    % cvs update -A
    % fink selfupdate

  To switch to 'rsync', the following command will update according to
  the rsync server (and retain that setting for selfupdate in the
  future). Fink's rsync selfupdate servers have never had the
  pangocairo branch.

    % fink selfupdate-rsync
