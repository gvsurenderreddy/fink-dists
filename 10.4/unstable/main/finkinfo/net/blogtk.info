Description: Weblog client for linux
DescDetail: <<
BloGTK is a weblog client that allows you to post 
to your weblog from unix without the need for a 
separate browser window. BloGTK allows you to 
connect with many weblog systems such as Blogger, 
Movable Type, pMachine, and more. BloGTK is written 
using Python  and PyGTK , and is designed to be fast 
and simple to use.

BloGTK is open-source software released under the 
BSD license, which means that it is completely 
free for use.

BloGTK won't make you more attractive to the 
opposite sex, it won't create world peace, and it 
doesn't make julienne fries. It does make updating 
your weblog from Linux much easier and more efficient. 
On the other hand, that could make you more attractive 
to the opposite sex. (Guarantee of attractiveness void 
in this dimension.)
